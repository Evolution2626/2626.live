# livestream-website
This livestream template was created to give to FIRST Robotics team the resources to host their own personalized livestream website.


This website was created by FÃ©lix Giffard, a member of Evolution 2626. We wanted to have a short and memorable url to give to friends and family so that it would be easy for them to watch the team live at competitions. We then decided to buy the domain name 2626.live using the new .live tld. 


We then decided to host the website directly on Github Pages and to build a little widget that gives information about our score and details about our matches in real time using The Blue Alliance API and some JavaScript magic.
